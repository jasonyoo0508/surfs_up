## surfs_up Weather Analysis

# Overview

Avy would like a specific, targeted information about the temperature trends before opening up his surf shop. 
Avy would like to have the temperature dataset for the months of June a nd December in Oahu, to determine whether it would be reasonable to keep the icecream store all year around.

# June Temperature

Out of the 1700 occurances of measuring the temperature, the June temperature results show the mean temperature (average) would be 74.9 F.
Max temp being 85 F, and the min temp being 64 F.

# December Temperature

Out of the 1514 occurances of measuring the temperature, the December temperature results show the mean temperature (average) of 71.04 F.
The Max temp would be 83 vs min being 53, where the minimum temperature would most likely in the late nights.

# Analysis & Results

1. By comparing the June & December temperature, the average temperatures between the two months are similar if we review the average figure. However, the min/max of the temperatures are vastly different when we look at June or December. As December being relatively colder, the minimum temperature would be 53, whereas June would be 64 F.

However, if he wants to run the icecream shop based on the temperature information, there would be no problem. The low/high temperature for the two months would have to be the peak months for the season (summer & winter) and since there are no drastic fluctuation on the temperature, it would still be reasonable to sell the products, ONLYIF the owner would like to open the shop all year based on the temperature data.


* Additional Queries

1. In order to draft a more detailed information on the temperature, it would be helpful to see the timeframe on when the min/max temperatures are recorded. The minimum temperature figure is different from June/Dec but we would have to know whether the temperature was measured in the daytime or the nighttime to determine whether the whether fluctuation was due to the sun rise & down. 

2. One other option would be to gather information on the location. If the town is located in a higher altitude, much higher than the ground level, there are researches that indicate the temperature or climate itself would have random measures.
